# Gowdham's Digital Brain

Welcome to my digital brain!

This repository serves as my personal Obsidian vault, a digital space where I organize thoughts, store knowledge, and explore ideas. While you can navigate the markdown files directly, the full experience is best achieved with Obsidian.

This Obsidian vault is published online atÂ [https://notes.gowdhamp.in](https://notes.gowdhamp.in/)

### Notes Philosophy

- **Treasures:**
  - Notes are treasures left for my future self and others.
  - Each note encapsulates a thought or idea with meaning.
- **Organization:**
  - Despite the vastness, organization is key.
  - Structured chaos, where each note has its place.
