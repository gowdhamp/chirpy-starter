# Monit Config for Base System Monitoring

Monitor system CPU, RAM and root file system for abnormal utilization and generate email alerts. To avoid false alarms, the `loadavg` and `memory usage` need to be adjusted after understanding the baseline usage of each server and application.

```sh
# Monit config to monitor CPU, RAM and disk usage
# File: /etc/monit/conf.d/system

check system $HOST
    if loadavg (5min)  > 3 for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
    if loadavg (15min) > 2 for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
    if memory usage > 80% for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
    if swap   usage > 20% for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
    if cpu usage (user)   > 80% for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
    if cpu usage (system) > 20% for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
    if cpu usage (wait)   > 20% for 4 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh

check filesystem "root" with path /
    if space usage > 25% for 8 cycles then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
```
