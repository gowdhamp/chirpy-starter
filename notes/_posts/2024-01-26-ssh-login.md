# Monit Config for Alerting SSH Logins

Watch `/var/log/auth.log` for ssh logins and send email alerts.

```sh
# Monit config to alert on ssh logins
# File: /etc/monit/conf.d/ssh_login

# watch /var/log/auth.log for ssh logins and email alert
# on successful and failed logins

check file ssh_accepted_logins with path /var/log/auth.log
        if match "Accepted" then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh

check file ssh_failed_logins with path /var/log/auth.log
        if match "Failed" then exec /usr/local/sbin/monit-alerts.sh
```
